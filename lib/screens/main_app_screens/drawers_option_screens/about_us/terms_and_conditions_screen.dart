In each case, images should be uploaded only when you have consent from the people depicted or their parents/guardians, as the case may be.

You must explain how the images and stories will be used and should show examples to clarify this. It must be made clear that the images will be used widely and internationally. No promises about limiting usage should be made.

c) Authenticity: You should always show a true and accurate account of the ways in which people live. Authenticity is the key to upholding our reputation; never use images that make people look more desperate or powerless than they are. You should always portray the real emotions of the people. Hrtaa does not encourage manufacturing fake vulnerability for the sake of emotional appeal. For instance, if a parent does not want to cry, or fold their hands while making a donation appeal, do not force them to do so. Manipulation of images in post-production is strictly prohibited if it negatively affects image authenticity.

d) Child protection issues: You must be mindful of child protection issues. Kindly adhere to the following while shooting children's pictures.

i. Nudity: You will not take or use images that show children naked from the waist down, or older female children from the waist up. We will not set up images to make children look more vulnerable.

ii. Manipulation: It is vital that your images show reality and are not set up or manipulated to make a situation look worse than it is. For instance, you will not ask the child to fold their hands, say words suggested by you, or instruct them to cry on camera for a donation appeal. You will also make sure that at no point is the child is asking for funds, any funding appeal is strictly limited to the parents or guardians.

iii. Privacy: Be mindful of using children's real or full names alongside their images, and assess if such use can cause harm (e.g., if the child has a disease that causes social stigma). In such cases, you may use the child's first name only. Also, publishing a child's location (e.g., the name of their village) should be re-evaluated.

e) Use respectful and appropriate images: Choose images that are respectful and appropriate for all audiences. Do not use images that are violent, sexual, or discriminatory in any way. The images you publish should also comply with the laws of the land, and should not be indecent, obscene, misleading, objectionable, portray or focus on ailments or deformities egregiously, or otherwise demean an individual or group.

Copyright Complaints: Hrtaa respects the intellectual property of others, and we ask our users to do the same. If you believe that your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, or that your intellectual property rights have been otherwise violated, you should notify Hrtaa of your infringement claim in accordance with the procedure set forth below.

Hrtaa will process and investigate notices of alleged infringement and will take appropriate actions under the applicable intellectual property laws with respect to any alleged or actual infringement. A notification of claimed copyright infringement should be emailed to Hrtaa's Copyright Agent at info@Hrtaa.org (Subject line: "Takedown Request").

To be effective, the notification must be in writing and contain the following information:

an electronic or physical signature of the person authorised to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright or other intellectual property interest;
a description of the copyrighted work or other intellectual property that you claim has been infringed;
a description of where the material that you claim is infringing is located on the Services, with enough detail that we may find it on the Services;
your address, telephone number, and email address;
a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorised by the copyright or intellectual property owner, its agent, or the law;
a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in your Notice is accurate and that you are the copyright or intellectual property owner or authorised to act on the copyright or intellectual property owner's behalf.
Counter-Notice: If you believe that your User Content that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or that you have the authorisation from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or pursuant to the law, to upload and use the content in your User Content, you may send a written counter-notice containing the following information to the Copyright Agent:

your physical or electronic signature;
identification of the content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the content appeared before it was removed or disabled;
a statement that you have a good faith belief that the content was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the content; and
your name, address, telephone number, and email address, a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the federal court located within Mumbai, Maharashtra, India and a statement that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.
If a counter-notice is received, Hrtaa will send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that it may replace the removed content or cease disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the content provider, member or user, the removed content may be replaced, or access to it restored, in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at our sole discretion.

Repeat Infringer Policy: In accordance with the DMCA and other applicable law, Hrtaa has adopted a policy of terminating, in appropriate circumstances and at Hrtaa's sole discretion, users who are deemed to be repeat infringers. Hrtaa may also at its sole discretion limit access to the Services and/or terminate the memberships of any users who infringe any intellectual property rights of others, whether or not there is any repeat infringement.
